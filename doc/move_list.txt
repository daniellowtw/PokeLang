- Notation
instruction | move | type | pre | post | description

( a b ) where b is the top of the stack
a indexed as the first argument

arguments/args refer to the topmost objects on the stack

#a  number named a
{}a block named a
[]a array named a
[a,b,c] array with a, b and c as elements
(_) indeterminate state

( a )[1 : b, 2 : {c}] stack with current dictionary 1:b, 2:{c}

- Stack Manipulation
<num> | TACKLE | obj:num | () | ( #a ) | pushes target pokemon's pokedex no. on the stack
pop | POISONSTING | op | ( a ) | ( ) |
dup | ROCKTHROW | op | ( a ) | ( a a ) | pushes a copy of the arg on the stack
swap | VINEWHIP | op | ( a b ) | ( b a ) | swaps the top 2 objects on the stack  
rot3 | RAZORLEAF | op | ( a b c ) | ( c a b ) | rearragnes the top 3 objects of the stack

- Arithmetic
+ | EMBER | op | ( #a #b ) | ( #a+#b ) | addition
- | WATERGUN | op | ( #a #b ) | ( #a-#b ) | subtraction
* | FLAMETHROWER | op | ( num 1 num 2 ) | ( #a*#b ) | multiplication
/ | HYDROPUMP | op | ( #a #b ) | ( #a/#b ) | integer division

- Comparison
== | POUND | ( a b ) | ( a==b ) | equal to
> | HEADBUTT | ( a b ) | (a > b ) | strictly greater than
>= | BITE | ( a b ) | (a > b ) | greater than or equal to
<= | HORNATTACK | ( a b ) | (a > b ) | lesser than or equal to
< | BODYSLAM | ( a b ) | (a > b ) | strictly lesser than

- Arrays
[ | MEGAPUNCH | obj:mark | () | ([) | mark start of array
] | THUNDERPUNCH | op | ( [ a b c ) | ( [a,b,c] ) | create array with objects up to mark
get | FIREPUNCH | op | ( []a num ) | ( a[num] ) | get num of index a
put | ICEPUNCH | op | ( []a num obj ) | ( []_ ) | index num of a updated to obj
fold | MEGAKICK | op | ( []a {}a ) | (_) | fold {a} over []a
map | HIJUMPKICK | op | ( []a {}a ) | ([]_) | map {a} over []a

- Blocks
{ } | THUNDERShOCK THUNDERBOLT | obj:block | () | ( {}a ) | 
exec | THUNDER | op | ( {}a ) | (_) | exec block object

- Dictionary
store | CONFUSION | op | ( num a ) | ()[num: a] | store num:a in dictionary
load | PSYBEAM | op | ( num )[num: a] | (a)[num: a] | push value of a in dictionary

- Control Flow
ifelse | EARTHQUAKE | op | ( #c {}a {}b ) | (_) | if c then exec {}a else {}b
while | SCRATCH | op | ( #b {}a ) | (_) | while b exec {}a

- Printing
out | SLASH | op | ( #a ) | ( ) | prints the ASCII represented by number
